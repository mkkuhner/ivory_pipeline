This pipeline takes an Elephant Master Database and creates the data
files needed by other pipelines, such as the ivory and familial matching
pipelines.

***A)  Create a SCAT-style reference file

A1)  Determine the PREFIX of the new database file.  Currently they are
called REFELE_[DBno], where DBno is the numeric ID of the copy of
the Master Elephant Genotypes file from which they were take.  (This
scheme supersedes the old version containing the year.)

A2)  Obtain the current ElephantMasterDatabase.xlsx file.  Save the tab
named "Reference Genotypes Stats" as PREFIX_raw.csv (using comma as
delimiter).

A3)  Run make_raw_ref_data.py with PREFIX_raw.csv and PREFIX_known.txt
as the two arguments.  This creates a SCAT-style file with no header.

***B)  Make a Structure file corresponding to the new reference.

2)  Edit the "mainparams" file (in the auxillary_files directory)
to set the INFILE to PREFIX_known.txt and the OUTFILE to 
PREFIX_known_structure.txt.  Set NUMINDS to the total individuals in your
reference set (bearing in mind that the input file has 2 lines per
individual).  Set NUMLOCI to your number of loci (16 for standard elephant
microsat data) and MISSING to "-999".

3)  Run Structure.  You do not need to set any command line options as they
are handled by "mainparams".  Your output file will have the name you gave
it in "mainparams" followed by "_f".  This takes minutes.

4)  Archive the resulting file for future use.

WARNING:  Structure makes an arbitrary choice whether forest or savannah is
Species 1.  This is corrected by the downstream script make_eb_input.py
so that savannah is always Species 1, but the Structure results themselves
are not modified.  If you use this file for anything other than the pipeline,
you must diagnose which species is Species 1.  Our canonical way to do this 
is to check elephant CH0878, a clearly savannah reference elephant; whichever 
column (1 or 2) of Structure results has high values for this individual is 
savannah.  

***C)  Filter out hybrids to prepare for familial matching

1)  Put the EBhybrids R scripts (in src) and the file ebscript_template.R
(in auxillary_files) in the working directory.

2)  Run make_eb_input using the special flag "reference" to indicate that you 
are using only reference data (no seizure data):  

python make_eb_input PREFIX_structure_output.txt_f PREFIX 
  dropoutrates_savannahonly.txt reference

This will write an EBhybrids run script as well as REFERENCE_ancestryprobs.txt.

3)  Execute the EBhybrids run script ebscript.R (using Rscript).  This will
write PREFIX_HPs.csv and .txt, and PREFIX_hybt.csv and .txt.  It is fast.

4)  Run remove_hybrids_from_reference.py with PREFIX as its argument.
This will write PREFIX_nohybrids.txt, which contains all forest and savannah
reference samples but no hybrids.

5)  Create an output directory for SCAT2 results.  Run SCAT2 in 
subregion inference mode as follows:

SCAT2 -Z -H2 PREFIX_nohybrids.txt regionfile outdir 16

(where 16 is the number of loci).  This is quick as it is not doing MCMC to assign
individuals.
