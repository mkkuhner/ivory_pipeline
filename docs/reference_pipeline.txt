This pipeline takes an Elephant Master Database and creates the data
files needed by other pipelines, such as the ivory and familial matching
pipelines.

***A)  Create a SCAT-style reference file

A1)  Determine the PREFIX of the new database file.  Currently they are
called REFELE_[DBno], where DBno is the numeric ID of the copy of
the Master Elephant Genotypes file from which they were take.  (This
scheme supersedes the old version containing the year.)

A2)  Obtain the current ElephantMasterDatabase.xlsx file.  Save the tab
named "Reference Genotypes Stats" as PREFIX_raw.csv (using comma as
delimiter).

A3)  Run make_raw_ref_data.py with PREFIX_raw.csv and PREFIX_known.txt
as the two arguments.  This creates a SCAT-style file with no header.

***B)  Make a Structure file corresponding to the new reference.

1) Make a reference file for Structure by prepending header_for_structure
(in the auxillary_files directory) to REFELE_[DBno]_known.txt and naming
it REFELE_[DBno]_structure.txt.

2)  Edit the "mainparams" file (in the auxillary_files directory)
to set the INFILE to REFELE_[DBno]_structure.txt and the OUTFILE to 
REFELE_[DBno]_known_structure.txt.  Set NUMINDS to the total individuals in your
reference set (bearing in mind that the input file has 2 lines per
individual).  Set NUMLOCI to your number of loci (16 for standard elephant
microsat data) and MISSING to "-999".

3)  Run Structure.  You do not need to set any command line options as they
are handled by "mainparams".  Your output file will have the name you gave
it in "mainparams" followed by "_f".  This takes minutes.

4)  Archive the resulting file for future use.

WARNING:  Structure makes an arbitrary choice whether forest or savannah is
Species 1.  This is corrected by the downstream script make_eb_input.py
so that savannah is always Species 1, but the Structure results themselves
are not modified.  If you use this file for anything other than the pipeline,
you must diagnose which species is Species 1.  Our canonical way to do this 
is to check elephant CH0878, a clearly savannah reference elephant; whichever 
column (1 or 2) of Structure results has high values for this individual is 
savannah.
