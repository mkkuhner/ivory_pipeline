This pipeline takes an Elephant Master Database and creates the data
files needed by other pipelines, such as the ivory and familial matching
pipelines.

***A)  Create a SCAT-style reference file

A1)  Determine the PREFIX of the new database file.  Currently they are
called REFELE_NNC, where NN is the two-digit year and C is a letter
indicating different versions in the same year.  However, it may be
better to key them to the name of the master database.

A2)  Obtain the current ElephantMasterDatabase.xlsx file.  Save the tab
named "Reference Genotypes Stats" as PREFIX_raw.csv.

A3)  Run make_raw_ref_data.py with PREFIX_raw.csv and PREFIX_known.txt
as the two arguments.  This creates a SCAT-style file with no header.

***B)  Make a Structure file corresponding to the new reference.

Instructions for this are found as step B) in the seizure_pipeline.txt
document.  You will need a copy of the file "header_for_structure" to
supply the needed header.
