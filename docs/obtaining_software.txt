This document gives step by step instructions for obtaining software
needed for the ivory pipeline, but not present on the ivory_pipeline
GitHub site because it already had a repository elsewhere.  It also
contains basic compiling instructions for the compiled programs.

These instructions were tested on Ubuntu Linux.  Most of them will
probably work on other Linux distributions; they may work on Mac OSX;
we have never tried them on Windows and do NOT expect them to work.  
Your best bet on a Windows machine might be a Linux emulator.

(0)  Git

To make best use of the repositories, you will need to obtain and install
git.  On an Ubuntu or Debiun Linux system, you can do this with:

sudo apt install git-all

You will need an access token:  see the following web resource.  Be
sure to save the access token in a safe place.  Never put them in
repositories.

(1)  Python

You will, unfortunately, need both python2 and python3 interpreters 
for this pipeline; two programs rely on the Basemap package which is 
only available for python2, whereas several others rely on python3 
libraries.  Install both (as appropriate for your system) and keep 
an eye on which one you are using.  Except for the two python2 programs,
screen output will be easier to read if you always use python3.

(2)  SCAT2

The repository is at:

https://github.com/stephens999/scat

The master branch should be used unless you know that there are recent
bug fixes in the development branch which would make it preferable.  If 
you do not have a copy of this repository, check it out with:

git clone https://github.com/scat
git checkout master

(if you need a different branch than "master" substitute it in the second
line).

Change directory into the /src directory of the resulting repository.
Type "make" to compile the program.  The executable will appear in the
same directory and will be called SCAT2.

This is a C++ program and relies on presence of the g++ compiler.  You
can edit the file "Makefile" to point to a different compiler if
necessary.

If you have previously compiled SCAT2 in this directory we recommend
"make clean" before "make".

(3)  VORONOI

The repository is at:

https://github.com/stephens999/voronoi

Check out as for SCAT2:  again, unless you specifically know you need the
development branch, use the master branch.

Change directory into the /src directory of the resulting repository
and type "make".  The executable will be called VORONOI.

(4)  Structure

This program can be downloaded from:

https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure_software/release_versions/v2.3.4/html/structure.html

You can download compiled executables or C++ source code, as preferred.
Our instructions assume the command line version, not the graphical interface.

(5)  EBhybrids

The repository is at:

https://github.com/stephenslab/EBhybrids

This is R code and needs to be copied into the directory where you
will run it.

(6)  Familial matching

The repository is at:

https://github.com/cwolock/elephant_fam_match

However, currently the version relied on by this pipeline is NOT on the
repository; you will need to obtain a copy from Mary Kuhner.
