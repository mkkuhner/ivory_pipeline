This file explains how to pull seizure data from the master database
and prepare it to feed into the seizure pipeline.  It is different from
the standard seizure pipeline because the "For Scat" tab found in new
seizure data is not present in the master database, and the tabs that
are present are differently formatted..

A.  Extract seizure (ivory) data from master database.

1.  Choose a PREFIX for this run.  Currently we are using [date]_seizures.

2.  Load the master database .xlsx file into LibreOffice and go to the tab
named "Ivory Genotypes Stats (10+Loci)" (double-check you have the correct
tab!).  Save this sheet as PREFIX_spreadsheet.csv.

3.  Run the Python script make_raw_ivory_data.py with the file you just
created as input, and PREFIX_raw.tsv as output.  This will transform the
"wide" format database information into "long" format Scat-style information.

You are now ready to join the seizure pipeline at step A4 (running
prep_scat_data).
