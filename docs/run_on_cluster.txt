Revised instructions to run on the Klone cluster (klone.hyak.uw.edu)

Loggin in:
You do not need to use the VPN (HuskyOnNet) for this.

ssh mkkuhner@klone.hyak.uw.edu (will ask for two-factor auth)

cd /gscratch/wasser/mkkuhner  (or use alias 'home')

Run a job:
navigate to directory with a run script
module load gcc/10.2.0
sbatch runscript.sh

[The "module load" is essential here, not just for compiles, or you will
get errors referencing the Fortran libraries.]

Check on a job:
squeue -p compute

[Substitute the name of the partition you used for "compute" if you used
a different one.]

Kill a job (jobid can be obtained from squeue):
scancel jobid 

Compile programs:

See file compile_on_cluster.

Sample run scripts:

See file cluster_master_runfile.sh in ivory_pipeline/src.  Note that the
version given there runs *one* SCAT run, not a full set of 9.
