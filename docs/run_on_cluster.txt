Revised instructions to run on the Klone cluster (klone.hyak.uw.edu)

Loggin in:
You do not need to use the VPN (HuskyOnNet) for this.

ssh mkkuhner@klone.hyak.uw.edu (will ask for two-factor auth)

cd /gscratch/wasser/mkkuhner  (or use alias 'home')

Run a job:
navigate to directory with a run script
module load gcc/10.2.0
sbatch runscript.sh

[The "module load" is essential here, not just for compiles, or you will
get errors referencing the Fortran libraries.  However, this command is
now embedded in our standard SCAT run script, so need not be typed
separately.]

Check on a job:
squeue -p compute

[Substitute the name of the partition you used for "compute" if you used
a different one.]

Kill a job (jobid can be obtained from squeue):
scancel jobid 

Sample run scripts:

See file cluster_master_runfile.sh in ivory_pipeline/src.  Note that the
version given there runs *one* SCAT run, not a full set of 9.

Older scripts for Mox will not run.

Compile programs:

Based on 
https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/Hyak+Compiling+HDF5+Serial
but with substantial modification.  These instructions are currently tested
only for SCAT.

(0)  You will need a compiled LAPACK library for SCAT.  The library
is currently in /gscratch/wasser/mkkuhner/scat/ and can be built with
"cmake" (I could not get "Make" to work).  You will need the same module
load as in step #3.  If you compile it elsewhere, you will then need to modify 
the SCAT Makefile to point to it.

(1) Get the code onto your /gscratch user directory.

(2)  For SCAT, be sure you have the cluster version Makefile (comment in the
line with a path to -llapack and comment out the alternative).

(3) For SCAT, module load gcc/10.2.0 (needed for Fortran calls in LAPACK 
library).

(4)  Make the code (usually configure comes first, but we have none).
On the older cluster they did not like us to do this on the head
node, and wanted us to spawn an interactive session instead, but I
do not have instructions that work for that on Klone.  In any case
our compiles are pretty fast.

Note that you will also need the module load command to run the resulting
executable.
