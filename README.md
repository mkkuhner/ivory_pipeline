Ivory Seizure Analysis Pipeline

These are scripts and programs used to handle our bioinformatics pipeline which takes microsatellite data from an ivory shipment and infers the locations and familial relationships of the elephants from which it came.  At many points they are quite specific to African elephants, though the core bioinformatics would work on other species.  They are also specific to microsats, though again the core code would work with SNPs or microhaps.
The pipeline contains copies of code maintained elsewhere.  Please don't redistribute these without permission of the original maintainers.
The pipeline will run on Debian Linux and probably on other forms of Linux, maybe MacOSX, certainly not Windows.  Programs are in Python2, Python3, R, and C++.  (Python2 is temporarily retained to use the "Basemap" library and will be phased out soon.)
